### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, guys, i'm Yanppeng Chen , a PhD student majoring in Biomedical Sciences. Currently, I am doing my PhD study at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, mainly focusing fungal taxonomy, more specifically, using phylogenomic methods to stablize The Fungal Tree of Life.  

I learned R, Python and Shell languages. I use shell and Python for daily works. I also have some knowledge of Makefile and Perl language. I take great care in the experience and code quality of the things I build.
